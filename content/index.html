			<p>This document provides use cases and a vocabulary of terms that can be used to enhance web content by providing information about form controls, symbols, and other user interface elements. User agents use the semantics to augment or adapt content to the user’s scenario. This helps users with varying needs to understand the content by providing support for simplification and a way to manage unnecessary distractions.</p>
			<p>The Personalization Semantics Content Module 1.0 is an extension of the personalization semantics introduced in the <a href="../">Personalization Semantics Explainer 1.0</a> document [[personalization-semantics-1.0]].</p>

			<h1>Introduction</h1>
     
            <p>This document provides personalization semantics and vocabularies that can be used to annotate web content enabling user agents to augment or adapt content to various user scenarios based on the user’s personalization settings or preferences.</p>
			
			<p class="ednote" id="examples-disclaimer">Personalization semantics defines a set of properties and values to annotate content. The Personalization Task Force decide to use the data-* for attributes, Now the the first three attributes have been accepted by Task Force, there are data-purpose, data-action and data-destination. For other attributes, we are still on discussion. See our  discussion <a href="https://github.com/w3c/personalization-semantics/wiki/Prototypes-with-data-dash-*-(Take-2)">Prototypes with data dash</a>.  If you have any comments or suggestions on implementation please add a comment to this <a href="https://github.com/w3c/personalization-semantics/issues/">issue list</a>.</p>

				<h3>Significant editorial changes since the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/WD-personalization-semantics-tools-1.0-20181018/">First Public Working Draft</a></h3>
			        <ul>
			          <li>2019-07-04: The task force has accepted the name and values of three attributes for the Content module: data-action, data-destination and data-purpose. Other properties in the vocabulary are not yet mature enough to suggest using them in production HTML with data- attributes.</li>
