			<p>Personalization involves tailoring aspects of the user experience to meet the needs and preferences of the individual user. For example, having familiar terms and symbols is key to many users being able to use the web. However, what is familiar for one user may not be familiar to another, requiring them to learn new symbols. The challenge has been the ability to identify the types of content in a document that should be adapted to the preferred user experience. The introduction of standardized semantics allows web applications to customize the presentation of that content to one that is familiar to individuals based on their specific needs and preferences. This specification defines standard semantics to enable user driven personalization. For example, the association of user-preferred symbols with elements having those semantics. This ensures that users can quickly find familiar icons, for example, a help icon, within the context of user interface elements.</p>
			<p>This document is an explanation for understanding how to use Personalization properties to personalize an accessible web site.</p>

			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>The goals of this specification include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Expanding the accessibility information that may be supplied by the author;</li>
				<li> Facilitate preference driven individual personalization;</li>
				<li> Enable the author to specify key semantics needed to support users with cognitive impairments</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is a proposal for defining syntax for adaptable content such as: links, buttons, symbols, help and keyboard. This may be a WAI-ARIA COGA Extension, however implementation methods are currently being explored.</p>
			<!--<p>Personalization involves tailoring aspects of the user experience to meet the preferences or needs of the user. For example, having familiar terms and symbols is key to being able to use the web. However what is familiar for one user may be new for another requiring them to learn new symbols. Personalization could include loading a set of symbols that is appropriate for the specific user, ensuring that all users find the icons simple and familiar.</p> -->
			<p>Technology holds the promise of being extremely flexible and the design of many systems includes the expectation that users will be able to optimize their interaction experience according to their personal preferences or accessibility needs. </p>

				<h2>Why We Need Personalization</h2>
				<p>We need personalization because: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>The needs of individual user may conflict.</li>
					<li>Learning new design patterns, widgets, and user interfaces can be confusing. We would like to give users the ability to decide what works best for them based on preference and ability.</li>
					<li>Extra support can be a distraction for people who do not need it.</li>
					<li>Making content predictable is necessary for accessibility but can often lead to less innovate design.</li>
					<li>Ability to increase or decrease levels of complexity as people's skills improve or decline over time.</li>
					<li>Enable websites to adapt to and meet the user's needs.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Some users need extra support. This can include: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Symbols and graphics that they are familiar with</li>
					<li>Tooltips</li>
					<li>Language they understand</li>
					<li>Less features</li>
					<li>Separating advertisements so users don't confuse them with native content </li>
					<li>Keyboard short cuts</li>
				</ul>
				<p>To achieve this we need standardized terms and supportive syntax. These can be linked to associated symbols, terms, translations and explanations. They are then provided to an individual based on personal preferences.</p>
				<p>For example, assume an author can make it programmatically known that a button sends an email. Based on user preferences, the button renders with a symbol, term, and/or tooltips that are understandable by this particular user. It could automatically include F1 help that explains the send function in simple terms. It could be identified with a keyboard short cut that is always used for send. In addition, the button could be identified as important and always rendered, or always rendered very large. </p>
				<p>Working examples of how this could be used in practice, with user preferences, are available on the task force <a href="https://github.com/w3c/personalization-semantics/wiki/Implementations-of-Semantics">implementations page</a>. </p>
					<p>Another use-case we would like to see is interoperable symbol set codes for non-verbal people. Products for people who are non-vocal often use symbols to help users communicate. These symbols are in fact an individual's language. Unfortunately many of these symbols are both subject to copyright and are not interoperable. That means end-users can only use one device, and can not use applications or assistive technologies from a different company. An open set of references for symbol codes for these symbol sets however, could be interoperable. That means the end user could use an open source symbol set or buy the symbols and use them across different devices or applications. Symbols could still be proprietary but they would also be interoperable.</p>

				<h2>Use Cases</h2>
				<p><a href="requirements/">Requirements for Personalization Semantics</a> [[personalization-semantics-requirements]] elaborates many use cases that further contextualize the above summary of user needs. These use cases form the basis of requirements for this technology.</p>

				<h2>Modules</h2>
				<p>This specification has been divided into modules. </p>
				<p>Each module has use cases and vocabularies: </p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="content/index.html">Adaptable Content:</a>
					<p>This section provides vocabularies that enable user agents to augment or adapt content to the user scenario and helps the user use and understand the content.</p>
					<p>It includes use cases and vocabularies for identifying the purpose of controls, symbols  and user interface elements and supports simplification and avoiding distractions.</p></li>
				
					<li><a href="help/index.html">Adaptable Help and Support:</a>
					<p>The first working draft of this module is now available.</p>
					<p>It addresses adding information about the content to enable help scaffolding and additional support for different user scenarios.</p></li>
				
					<li><a href="tools/index.html">Adaptable Tools</a>
					<p>The first working draft of this module is now available.</p>
					<p>It addresses adding information about the content to enable user agents and extensions to provide addtional support to the user. One example is adaptable breadcrumbs.</p></li>

			<h1>Vocabulary Structure</h1>
			<p>Personalization Semantics is made of a vocabulary of properties and their values. This generic structure makes it possible to apply Personalization Semantics in a variety of contexts by adapting how the vocabulary is instantiated. The <a href="#vocabulary-implementations">Vocabulary Implementations</a> section below describes current ways to use the vocabulary.</p>
            <section>
                <h2>Properties</h2>
                <p>Properties are the main units of personalization types supported by the vocabulary. A given property supports a specific type of personalization. That property would only be used once on a given piece of content, but multiple different properties could be used on the same piece of content to address different needs.</p>
            </section>
			<section id="propcharacteristic_value">
				<h2>Values</h2>
				<p>Values provide the specific personalization information for the property. The possible values for each property are elabrated in the definition of the property in the modules. Some properties require the value to come from a predefined list of possible values, others can accept arbitrary strings, and some may accept multiple values. The value may be one of the following types:</p>
				<dl>
					<dt id="valuetype_true-false">true/false</dt>
					<dd>Value representing either true or false, with a default &quot;false&quot; value.</dd>
					<dt id="valuetype_true-false-undefined">true/false/undefined</dt>
					<dd>Value representing true or false, with a default &quot;undefined&quot; value indicating the state or property is not relevant.</dd>
					<dt id="valuetype_idref">ID reference</dt>
					<dd>Reference to the ID of another element in the same document</dd>
					<dt id="valuetype_idref_list">ID reference list</dt>
					<dd>A list of one or more ID references.</dd>
					<dt id="valuetype_integer">integer</dt>
					<dd>A numerical value without a fractional component.</dd>
					<dt id="valuetype_number">number</dt>
					<dd>Any real numerical value.</dd>
					<dt id="valuetype_string">string</dt>
					<dd>Unconstrained value type.</dd>
					<dt id="valuetype_token">token</dt>
					<dd>One of a limited set of allowed values.</dd>
					<dt id="valuetype_token_list">token list</dt>
					<dd>A list of one or more tokens.</dd>
					<dt id="valuetype_uri">URI</dt>
					<dd>A Uniform Resource Identifier as defined by <cite><a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC 3986</a></cite> [[RFC3986]]. It may reference a separate document, or a content fragment identifier in a separate document, or a content fragment identifier within the same document.</dd>

			<h2>Vocabulary Implementations</h2>
 
            <p>At the present stage of development, the Personalization Semantics vocabulary can be used in HTML content using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#embedding-custom-non-visible-data-with-the-data-attributes">data- attributes</a> [[html5]]. Attributes in this form can be used in valid HTML to implement features recognized by browser extensions or other special processors. Personalization Semantics is using this approach to gain early implementation experience of the features in a way that is simple and likely to be accepted within the web ecosystem as an interim approach.</p>
            <p>For this publication of Personalization Semantics, the task force has accepted the name and values of three attributes for the Content module:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="content/#action-explanation">data-action</a></li>
                <li><a href="content/#destination-explanation">data-destination</a></li>
                <li><a href="content/#purpose-explanation">data-purpose</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Other properties in the vocabulary are not yet mature enough to suggest using them in production HTML with data- attributes. Examples of those properties in the modules are to facilitate review, not to suggest implementation. See the discussion <a href="https://github.com/w3c/personalization-semantics/wiki/Prototypes-with-data-dash-*-(Take-2)">Prototypes with data dash</a>.</p>
            <p class="note">The HTML data- attribute syntax is not intended to be used for long-term wide-scale features. The task force is using this approach at the moment to gain implementation experience and demonstrate the usefulness of Personalization Semantics in practice. Content authors and user agent implementers should be aware that the recommended approach to use the vocabulary is expected to change, and structure their implementation in a manner that will facilitate the transition to a new syntax.</p>
